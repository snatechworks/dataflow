## Core Features:

- Pipeline Creation: Create ingestion pipelines with a web-based UI.
- Source Selection: Select data source type (HTTP, File, Database).
- Configuration Input: Enter config details (URL, index name) with UI forms.
- Pipeline Deployment: Deploy the created pipeline to Apache NiFi.
- Status Monitoring: View the current pipeline status and execution logs.
- Connection Testing: Test Elasticsearch connection from the UI.
- Configuration Validation: Use a tool to validate the configurations that are being saved, providing immediate user feedback.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#4285F4) to convey a sense of reliability and technological expertise.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), close to white, providing a clean, neutral backdrop to make the interface elements stand out.
- Accent color: Soft green (#34A853) to highlight success states and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that ensures clear readability.
- Use a set of simple, outline-style icons to represent data sources, pipeline components, and status indicators. Ensure icons are easily recognizable.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout with clearly defined sections for pipeline creation, configuration, and status monitoring. Use whitespace to create visual breathing room.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback to user interactions (e.g., deploying a pipeline, saving configurations). Keep animations short and non-intrusive.
